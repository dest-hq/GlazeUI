# Hello World example

This is a basic example which just shows "Hello World!" in the center of the window and does nothing

## Running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dest-hq/GlazeUI.git
cd GlazeUI
cd examples
cd hello_world
cargo run --release
# Ignore this line and the 2 below it, that command was supposed to work but it doesn't
# Will ask mxghj later how to fix since he knows both Rust and Cargo much better than me
# cargo run --release --package hello_world
```
